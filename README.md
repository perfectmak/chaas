# Chat As A Service

[![StyleCI](https://styleci.io/repos/54343425/shield)](https://styleci.io/repos/54343425)

This is an attempt for me to learn and gain an in-depth knowledge of nodejs and the javascript Reactive extension (RX).

The *Chaas* project is mean't to be a micro-service based framework, to make it easily setup realtime chating in your application.
In its early stage, it is mean't to be simple and should fulfill the following criteria:
- Easy Registration for users
- Realtime messaging
- CRUD Management of Users Chats
- CRUD Management of User Presence
- Daz all

To get a quick overview of the principle and structure of how the architecture of each micro-service will be structured,
I advice you read this post [Reactive MVC and Virtual Dom](http://futurice.com/blog/reactive-mvc-and-the-virtual-dom).

## Requirements

The software requirements for setting up this project is:
- Node
- MongoDB
- Daz all
